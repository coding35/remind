        "Phrase": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that contain data and methods to manipulate that data. It is a way of organizing and structuring software in a manner that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain.In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which are templates that define the properties and behaviors of objects. The properties of an object are represented by its attributes, while its behaviors are represented by its methods. One of the key features of OOP is encapsulation, which allows for the hiding of an object's internal details and the exposure of only its public interface. This helps to prevent accidental modification of an object's state and promotes modularity and code reuse. Inheritance is another important concept in OOP, which allows for the creation of new classes that inherit the properties and behaviors of existing classes. This helps to reduce code duplication and allows for the creation of more specialized classes. Polymorphism is also a key feature of OOP, which allows for the same method to behave differently depending on the context in which it is used. This helps to make code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements."
